Portable Programming for N64 Cartridge and Disk Drive
		Example Program

This directory contains a modified version of the simple demo which
uses more N64 features than the standard version.

It is designed to go along with the Nintendo64 Portable Programming
document, to illustrate how a program can be designed to operate 
in both cartridge and disk formats.  This program will be compiled
in three different ways when 'make' is executed:
	simple_d   -- Cartridge debug image
	simple_rom -- Cartridge ROM image
	simple_dd  -- Disk Drive debug image

To compile a specific version, execute in the following manner:
	Partner-NW: make SUBDIRS=*
	Partner-PC: make -f makefile.pc SUBDIRS=*
where * is a list of the images you'd like to compile.  All ROM images 
will be compiled into their respective subdirectories.

This program utilizes the N64 graphics, audio, and controller.  The
cartridge version uses the EEPROM (if it exists), and the Disk Drive
version uses the Disk Drive and Disk Drive ROM.

Functionality of the program-- it's the simple demo, plus read/write
capability.  
	Press the Z trigger to bring up a menu.  
	Use the camera up/down to move in the menu.
	Press A to select an option.
	Press the Z trigger to make the menu go away.

In Cartridge mode, all reads and writes are made to the EEPROM.
In DD mode, all reads and writes are made to the disk.

*** Please note that not all Disk Drive error conditions are currently
	checked for.  Just because I haven't done it doesn't mean you
	don't have to!  Check your Nintendo64 Disk Drive Programming
	Manual for proper procedures.
