README file for polyline demo
Author: Kevin Luster, kluster@sgi.com

The point behind this application is to demonstrate the usage of the
line microcode and show how it can be incorporated into polygon
applications.

For each frame in the application it first does a screen buffer clear,
then draws a background rectangle composed of two Gouraud shaded
triangles and then draws a rotating Gouraud shaded wireframe sphere on
top, after switching to the line microcode.

See the release notes for possible known line microcode problems which
will be fixed in later releases.
