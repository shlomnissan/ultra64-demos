This program prints data concerning the fill rate performance for triangles
of different areas and aspect ratios.  This data can easily be plotted
as a 3-D graph using gnuplot (see plot.gnu).

The program works by increasing the number of triangles until a
frame time is exceeded and then backing off slightly.  At this point
the fill rate is recorded and the next type of triangle is drawn.
The triangles are drawn at random locations, but within the 320x240
screen so that clipped triangles are not a factor.

To define the extents of the graph, define the constants (in fill.h):

ASPECT_HI
ASPECT_LO
ASPECT_STEP

AREA_HI
AREA_LO
AREA_STEP

Note that only the RDP performance is measured.  There is a certain amount
of DRAM bandwidth that is dedicated to loading the display list into the
input FIFO of the RDP.  To get the most accurate answers, you should run
with video blanked (-b option), and don't do frame buffer clears (-c option).
